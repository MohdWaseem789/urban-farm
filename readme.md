Vegetable store management is an implementation of storing, tracking, and maintaining the vegetable store. In turn, this helps the business owner monitor the sales, and growth of a business.
Sometimes, managing stores with a manual approach can be a tiresome process. There should be an application with simple functionality that can be understandable by a non-technical person like vegetable store owners. The application should be able to add products, generate bills, view sale history, and so on.
